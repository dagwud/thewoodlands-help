## Mercenaries
A party with too few people will struggle to make progress. To help with this, you can fill up your party with hired help. 

To do this, go to the Tavern and hire a mercenary.

Mercenaries are bot-controlled fighters who will come in at L1 and need to be trained up. 

They’ll do their own weapon repairs, but you’ll be responsible for providing them with ammunition if they choose to use a ranged weapon. You can collect extra ammunition bundles at the Blacksmith.

Mercenaries can never take your party beyond 4 members; any more than that and they’ll leave.
