## Parties
A party is a group of two or more characters fighting and traveling together.

To join a party, go to [The Tavern](locations/tavern/index.md) and use the Join Party option. All characters will need to use the same party
  name, and will then be grouped together. 
  
To create a new party, do the same - if you try to join a party that doesn't exist it will be created.

To join a party, that party must be somewhere within [The Village](locations/village_square/index.md). For example, you cannot join a party that is
  currently out fighting in [The Mountain](locations/mountain/index.md).

When you choose to join a party, you will also be asked for a group ID. If you have a Telegram group chat where
  coordinate/plan/chat together, you can enter the group chat ID here. Doing so (and adding the bot to this group
  chat) will cause the bot to send important updates to your group chat, such as when someone sends the party out
  fighting, or if anyone dies. You will also then be able to chat with party members by typing messages in your
  one-on-one bot chat, and these messages will be sent on to the group automatically. If you don’t want to use this
  functionality, simple enter a group ID of 0. Only one player need set this group ID, and it will then remain set for
  the party unless someone changes the group ID.

Party members have a certain level of control over one another. Any member who moves to a fighting area will cause
  the whole party to move, and any party member can instigate battles on behalf of the party. It is therefore possible
  to (perhaps accidentally) cause other people in your party to suffer an untimely death. This is a deliberate part of
  the dynamics of the game, and so it’s necessary to keep an eye on the health, weapons, etc. of all members in your
  party while adventuring.

To see information about the members of your party, use the `/party` command.

You can leave a party and go off on your own by going to [The Tavern](locations/tavern/index.md) and choosing the Leave Party option.

Any character can only be part of a single party at any time.
