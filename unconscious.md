### Unconscious
Taking too many beatings will leave you unconscious. While you’re out, you won’t be able to do anything. If you’re
  part of a party, then your conscious travel companions will drag your body around with them (at the expense of speed - they’ll move slower while they do).

To regain consciousness, your party should drag you back to [The Village](locations/village_square/index.md) (by simply issuing a command to move back
  to [The Village](locations/village_square/index.md)), where you can recover in the square.

Note that a party will move slower while dragging unconscious bodies.
