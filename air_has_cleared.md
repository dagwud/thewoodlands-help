### The Air Has Cleared and the World Seems... Different Somehow
Sometimes you may be pulled back to [The Village](/locations/village_square/index.md) unexpectedly, and get a message to the effect that the world seems
  different somehow.

This is an indication that the server has been restarted, possibly because of an update or possibly just for
  reasons.
