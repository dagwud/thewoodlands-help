## Welcome to the Woodlands

### Introduction
Out in the Old World, in a land that time forgot, stands a small village.

The Village itself is fairly unremarkable, but for the fact that it exists. Once it was a key trade center, but
  it’s nestled in a hotbed of powerful energies, and is surrounded by lands home to dark and dangerous creatures. Too
  many shipments disappeared mysteriously in the area; entire caravans lost with scant few surviving to return, and
  those who did told tales that few believed and even fewer wanted to.

Trade has all but dried up.

The Villagers have learned to survive by staying within the bounds of The Village, but the stories of beasts and
  monsters have made it the go-to location for adventurers seeking thrills and fame.

You are one of these adventures.

Will you make a name or glory and bravery? Of calmness in a dire situation? Or will your body be picked apart by
  the wild beasts and your name lost to history?

### TL;DR - Just Tell Me How to Play
Note: It’s highly recommended that you play with a few friends (or strangers) in a party. The experience is much
  better than going it alone - and soloing is hard.

- Join the [telegram channel](https://t.me/woodlands_raven) to ask questions. But please RTFM before
    asking.
  - Create a character (`/new`).
  - Head to [The Tavern](locations/tavern/index.md) and join a [Party](parties.md).
  - Send the Party to [The Petting Zoo](locations/petting_zoo/index.md) to earn experience. When necessary, retreat to [The Inn](locations/inn/index.md) to rest.
  - When you’re strong enough, start heading out into [The Mountain](locations/mountain/index.md) or [The Woodlands](locations/woodlands/index.md) instead of The Petting Zoo.
  - By this point you should have a solid grasp of the game mechanics and can start exploring the game further.
