<h2>Shield</h2>
<p>Shields offer some protection from attacks against you.</p>
<p>A shieldâ€™s job is to deflect incoming attacks, making it harder to hit you - so it will be more likely that your
  opponent will miss you. If they do land a hit, the damage you take will be unaffected by the shield (because they
  managed to evade your shield).</p>
<p>A shield also only offers a measure of protection - if you are severely outmatched in a fight, chances are the
  enemy will have no problem getting past your shield.</p>
