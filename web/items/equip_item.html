<h2>Equip Item</h2>
<p>Equipping an item readies if for active use.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: youâ€™re carrying a bunch of stuff in a bag on your back/strapped to your waist/etc. Equipping
  an item means taking it out and holding it in one of your hands.</p>
<p>You can only attack with weapons that are equipped, and a shield will only protect you if it is equipped.</p>
<p>Equipping certain trinkets, such as potions, will cause you to consume them. Equipping a Potion of Healing, for
  example, will cause you to drink the potion, gaining hit points back. At that point, the potion has been used and
  will disappear from your inventory.</p>
<p>To equip an item, use the /inv command and click the /e link next to the appropriate item.</p>
