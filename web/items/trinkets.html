<h2>Trinkets</h2>
<p>Trinkets are items that grant the holder special abilities.</p>
<p>Trinkets can briskly be divided into two categories: wearables and consumables.</p>
<p>Wearables are items that can be worn - cloaks, rings, beads, etc. They provide the wearer with special abilities,
  such as increased protection, bloodlust, mana regeneration, etc.</p>
<p>Consumables are once-off items, typically potions that you can drink. They give a once-off benefit such as
  restoring health or mana.</p>
<p>Potions can also be used to enchant items at the Alchemist.</p>
