<h2>If the Game Gets Stuck</h2>
<p>Sometimes, things go wrong. We don’t like it, but that’s the nature of things.</p>
<p>If the game seems to be confused - especially of the menu options you have don’t seem to match where you are - try
  doing a /cancel followed by a /look. No matter the state of the game, these two commands together should reset your
  menu options to match where you are.</p>
<p>If you repeatedly find this happening, please consider filling a bug. If you can include the steps you took to lock
  the game up like this, that will be very helpful in reproducing the issue and building a fix.</p>
