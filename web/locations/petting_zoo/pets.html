<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>You can tame pets using the 📚Animal Mastery skill.</p>
<p>Pets are loyal companions who’ll accompany you throughout your travels, because every good adventurer needs a
  pet.</p>
<p>Pets are tamed from the wild, so to get one you’ll need to #study at least first-level 📚Animal Mastery. Once
  you’ve done that, go to the Petting Zoo and use the /skill menu to start taming a wild beast to be your pet.</p>
<p>How long it takes and your chances of success are based on how much you’ve studied 📚 Animal Mastery (you can study
  skills more than once to get better at them)</p>
<p>If you leave the petting zoo while taming, your pet will run away and you’ll have to start over. While someone is
  taming a pet, no fights will happen. It’ll be weirdly quiet while you all just stand around watching.</p>
<p>Chance of successfully taming a pet:</p>
<p>L1 Animal Mastery: 20%</p>
<p>L2 Animal Mastery: 40%</p>
<p>L3 Animal Mastery: 60%</p>
<p>L4 Animal Mastery: 80%</p>
<p>The following types of animals can be tamed into pets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>🐍Snake</li>
  <li>🦅 Bird</li>
  <li>🦂Scorpion</li>
  <li>🐈 Cat</li>
  <li>🐀 Rat</li>
</ul>
<p>Pets can get into fights between themselves if left alone (Eg while the party rests).</p>
