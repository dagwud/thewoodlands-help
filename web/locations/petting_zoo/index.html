<h2>ðŸ¦¡The Petting ZooðŸ¦¡</h2>
<p>The Petting Zoo is an area of flat, open land just outside the Village Square. Itâ€™s not literally a Petting Zoo,
  but this is the nickname that stuck. As the closest area to the Village, this is where the mildest of the dangerous
  creatures from the neighboring areas tend to collect. As such, it makes for a good place for would-be adventurers to
  train and begin to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>If any member of your party is badly damaged while fighting in the Petting Zoo, the party will automatically
  retreat to the safety of the Village, where you can rest to tend your wounds. However, being knocked unconscious
  while alone mean that there is no one to carry you back to the Village, which means it will be the end of your
  adventures.</p>
