<h2>Claim Item</h2>
<p>Claiming items is the easiest way to gain new weapons/shields/trinkets.</p>
<p>Any time you do battle against a creature and defeat it (or it flees) there is a chance it will drop an item which
  can then be claimed by someone in the party.</p>
<p>Using the /party command will show if there are any unclaimed items that have been collected by your party. To
  claim one of these items, go to the Tavern and use the Claim Item option. Once an item is claimed, it will be moved
  into your inventory. You can then equip it for use, give it to someone else, drop it, leave it at the Innkeeper for
  later use, use it for crafting at the Blacksmith, or just carry it around with you.</p>
