<h2>⛰The Mountain⛰</h2>
<p>The Mountain overlooks the Village, and is home to a variety of small creatures. As such it has become something of
  a proving ground, where many adventurers hone their skills and practice basics.</p>
<p>It’s also a generally safe space as long as you’re not alone - tradition dictates that because this is a training
  area, any adventurer who falls in a fight will be carried back to the Village by their party. However, being knocked
  unconscious while alone does bring the risk that your body may be set upon by the inhabitants of the mountain.</p>
<p>As such, it’s best to travel in a group.</p>
