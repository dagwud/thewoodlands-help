<h2>The Inn</h2>
<p>The Inn is one of the oldest buildings in the Village, but these days it’s rooms are more often empty than not.</p>
<p>It’s been run by the same Innkeeper for as long as anyone can remember - a man beyond reproach who guarantees the
  safety off his guests with his life. Obviously, it’s a guarantee he’s never failed to live up to.</p>
<p>The innkeeper is a friend, and has offered to look after any items you may wish to leave behind while you're out on
  your adventures.</p>
<p>He also offers rooms where weary or beaten travelers can rest.</p>
