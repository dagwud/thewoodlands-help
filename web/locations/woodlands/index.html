<h2>ðŸŒ²The WoodlandsðŸŒ²</h2>
<p>The Woodlands is home to all manner of fearsome creatures. Stories abound of strange mystical beasts, none of whom
  are particularly friendly.</p>
<p>The Woodlands is the place where adventures who have honed their basic skills will spend most of their time proving
  themselves. Battles in the Woodlands require attention, as each round must be actively fought - if nobody in your
  party chooses to fight, you will automatically retreat. Conversely, the party will not automatically retreat as a
  result of injuries, so it is possible to wipe out your whole party if youâ€™re not paying attention.</p>
<p>To counterbalance this, victories in the Woodlands earn more experience.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the creatures you encounter will automatically scale based on the stats of your party.</p>
