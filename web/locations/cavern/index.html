<h2>Cavern Entrance</h2>
<p>Beyond the Mountain lies the entrance to a set of caves, rumored to spread for miles through the surrounding areas.
  The caverns are a labyrinthine complex, where a wrong turn can lead you to dangerous places.</p>
<p>There is a route from the Village to the Outpost through the Caverns which bypasses the treacherous open road.</p>
