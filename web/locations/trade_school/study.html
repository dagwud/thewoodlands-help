<h2>ğŸ“š Study</h2>
<p>From level 8 and up, you can start learning additional skills. Each skill unlocks an ability which you can perform
  using the /skill menu.</p>
<p>Your proficiency in a skill is determined by the number of courses you have completed in that skill.</p>
<p>Courses are offered at the Trade School, in the Outpost. Each time you level up, starting when you reach L8, you
  can complete one additional course.</p>
<p>The skills that you can study are:</p>
ğŸ“š Smithery - gives you the skills to repair items yourself
ğŸ“š First Aid - gives you the skills to perform field healing
ğŸ“š Animal Mastery - gives you the ability to tame a pet to travel with you
<p>Each skill can be further refined to make you better at it by attending additional courses.</p>
<p>You can study a range of different skills, or focus your efforts on a single skill and take repeat courses to gain
  more and more specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>To use a skill, use the /skill command</p>
<p>Drunkenness affects your ability to use skills. You have been warned...</p>
