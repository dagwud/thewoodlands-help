<h2>📚 Smithery</h2>
<p>Studying 📚Smithery unlocks the Repair Item skill, which allows you to repair any item carried by anyone in your
  party.</p>
<p>The higher your level of study, the more effective your repair work (ie how many hits you can restore to a damaged
  weapon). You’ll never be as good as the blacksmith though - at best, you can restore a weapon that’s got 0 hits
  remaining to 80% of its full heath. Repairing like this doesn’t require you to use another weapon for spares.</p>
