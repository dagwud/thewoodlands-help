<h2>Crafting</h2>
<p>Crafting allows you to combine two weapons into one better weapon. This manifests in the amount of hits the new
  weapon can deal before requiring repairs and, in the case of ranged weapons, the total ammunition the weapon
  holds.</p>
<p>Crafting two weapons gives you a boost to the resulting weapon’s max hits, but if your weapon is damaged and you
  craft with it, the resulting weapon won’t magically be capable of handling more hits than what it could before you
  crafted. It’s therefore wise to repair a weapon before using it in crafting.</p>
<p>When crafting ranged weapons, you also get increased ammunition capacity by combining two weapons together.</p>
