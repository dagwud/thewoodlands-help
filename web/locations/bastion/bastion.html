<h2>🏰The Bastion🏰</h2>
<p>This is a tower defense area. You don’t fight actively; rather, your role is to keep the towers defending the
  Village intact so they can repel the invading horde.</p>
<p>Each round, more and more creatures will attack at once. They will target the towers, and if the towers fall, they
  will then attack the party. You’ll automatically retreat if anyone is badly injured (like in the petting zoo or the
  mountain)</p>
<p>You have three actions available to you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deploy Tower: deploy an empty tower. It just looks pretty</li>
  <li>Arm Tower: put one of your weapons into the tower, which it will then attack with.</li>
  <li>Deploy Repair Team: dispatch a team of engineers to repair the damage done to the tower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tower has a fixed health, which can be replenished through the use of repair teams. Each tower can be armed
  with up to two weapons.</p>
<p>When a tower falls, the weapons arming it will be salvaged by the player who provided them.</p>
<p>There is no specific end (server resources aside): wave after wave will come at you until you can’t hold out. The
  goal is to see how long you can last.</p>
