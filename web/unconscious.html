<h2>Unconscious</h2>
<p>Taking too many beatings will leave you unconscious. While you’re out, you won’t be able to do anything. If you’re
  part of a party, then your conscious travel companions will drag your body around with them (at the expense of speed
  - they’ll move slower while they do).</p>
<p>To regain consciousness, your party should drag you back to the Village (by simply issuing a command to move back
  to the Village), where you can recover in the square.</p>
<p>Note that a party will move slower while dragging unconscious bodies.</p>
