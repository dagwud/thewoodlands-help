<h2>☠️Death</h2>
<p>Death is no fun. If you die, you’re dead, and there’s no coming back from it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, death isn’t that easy - you have to take a pretty big hit to die, or be knocked unconscious while on
  your own, with nobody to drag you back to safety.</p>
<p>If someone does die, they need to be honored and remembered. To cope with the loss, party members should host a
  wake at the tavern, where they’ll drink to their fallen compatriot (and should then probably sleep it off at the
  Inn). Of course, if you’re not part of a party then there will be no one to mourn you. But that’s just sad.</p>
<p>Tougher adventurers deserve bigger celebrations, and so the amount of alcohol consumed at a wake will be
  proportional to the skill of the fallen adventurer.</p>
<p>The hangover for a fallen L20 can last (literally) days.</p>
