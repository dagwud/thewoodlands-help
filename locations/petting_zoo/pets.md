### Pets
You can tame pets using the 📚Animal Mastery skill.

Pets are loyal companions who’ll accompany you throughout your travels, because every good adventurer needs a
  pet.

Pets are tamed from the wild, so to get one you’ll need to #study at least first-level 📚Animal Mastery. Once
  you’ve done that, go to the Petting Zoo and use the `/skill` menu to start taming a wild beast to be your pet.

How long it takes and your chances of success are based on how much you’ve studied 📚 Animal Mastery (you can study
  skills more than once to get better at them)

If you leave the petting zoo while taming, your pet will run away and you’ll have to start over. While someone is
  taming a pet, no fights will happen. It’ll be weirdly quiet while you all just stand around watching.

Chance of successfully taming a pet:

- L1 Animal Mastery: 20%
- L2 Animal Mastery: 40%
- L3 Animal Mastery: 60%
- L4 Animal Mastery: 80%

The following types of animals can be tamed into pets:

  - 🐍Snake
  - 🦅 Bird
  - 🦂Scorpion
  - 🐈 Cat
  - 🐀 Rat

Pets can get into fights between themselves if left alone (Eg while the party rests).
