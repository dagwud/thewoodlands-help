### ðŸ¦¡The Petting ZooðŸ¦¡
The Petting Zoo is an area of flat, open land just outside [The Village](../village_square/index.md) Square. Itâ€™s not literally a Petting Zoo,
  but this is the nickname that stuck. As the closest area to [The Village](../village_square/index.md), this is where the mildest of the dangerous
  creatures from the neighboring areas tend to collect. As such, it makes for a good place for would-be adventurers to
  train and begin to make a name for themselves.

If any member of your party is badly damaged while fighting in the Petting Zoo, the party will automatically
  retreat to the safety of [The Village](../village_square/index.md), where you can rest to tend your wounds. However, being knocked unconscious
  while alone means that there is no one to carry you back to [The Village](../village_square/index.md), which means it will be the end of your
  adventures.
