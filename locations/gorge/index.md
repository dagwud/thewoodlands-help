### 🐲The Gorge🐲
Over countless years, the river has cut a deep gorge through the terrain south of [The Village](../village_square/index.md).

Along the walls of this gorge, fearsome dragons have clawed out homes from the soft rock which also forms the cave
  system, and have made themselves at home. From here they launch raids out over the nearby farmlands to pick off
  sheep and cattle as they graze.

Of course, any traveler who ventures into the Gorge would also make a tasty snack.

Dragons, being flying creatures, cannot be attacked with melee weapons, so if you’re planning to venture into The
  Gorge, best you arm yourself with ranged weapons - and a clean set of underwear.
