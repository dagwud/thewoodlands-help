### The Village Square
The bustle of the village square brings a reassuring comfort to weary adventurers - the only danger here is the
  prices charged by the local bartender.

The square is dominated on the one side by the local tavern. Facing it, within stumbling range, is [The Inn](../inn/index.md).
