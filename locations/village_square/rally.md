### Rally
The `/rally` command allow you to summon your party to join you wherever you are. Because you cannot leave the
  Village (eg to go out into the Woodlands) without your whole party, this is an important command for gathering your
  party together - for example, if some lowlife has left their character in the Tavern, and thereâ€™s fighting to be
  done.

Rallying will have no effect on characters who are busy with something else - eg resting, studying or drinking.
