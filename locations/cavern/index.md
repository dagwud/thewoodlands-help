### Cavern Entrance
Beyond [The Mountain](/locations/mountain/index.md) lies the entrance to a set of caves, rumored to spread for miles through the surrounding areas.
  The caverns are a labyrinthine complex, where a wrong turn can lead you to dangerous places.

There is a route from [The Village](/locations/village_square/index.md) to [The Outpost](/locations/outpost/index.md) through the Caverns which bypasses the treacherous open road.
