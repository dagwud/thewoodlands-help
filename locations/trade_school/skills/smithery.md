### ðŸ“š Smithery
Studying ðŸ“šSmithery unlocks the Repair Item skill, which allows you to repair any item carried by anyone in your
  party.

The higher your level of study, the more effective your repair work (ie how many hits you can restore to a damaged
  weapon). Youâ€™ll never be as good as the blacksmith though - at best, you can restore a weapon thatâ€™s got 0 hits
  remaining to 80% of its full heath. Repairing like this doesnâ€™t require you to use another weapon for spares.
