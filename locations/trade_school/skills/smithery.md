### 📚 Smithery
Studying 📚Smithery unlocks the Repair Item skill, which allows you to repair any item carried by anyone in your
  party.

The higher your level of [study](../study.md), the more effective your repair work (ie how many hits you can restore to a damaged
  weapon). You’ll never be as good as [The Blacksmith](../../blacksmith/index.md) though - at best, you can restore a weapon that’s got 0 hits
  remaining to 80% of its full heath. Repairing like this doesn’t require you to use another weapon for spares.
