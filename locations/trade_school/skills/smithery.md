### ðŸ“š Smithery
Studying ðŸ“šSmithery unlocks the Repair Item skill, which allows you to repair any item carried by anyone in your
  party.

The higher your level of [study](/locations/trade_school/study.md), the more effective your repair work (ie how many hits you can restore to a damaged
  weapon). Youâ€™ll never be as good as [The Blacksmith](/locations/blacksmith/index.md) though - at best, you can restore a weapon thatâ€™s got 0 hits
  remaining to 80% of its full heath. Repairing like this doesnâ€™t require you to use another weapon for spares.
