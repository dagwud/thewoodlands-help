## ğŸ“š Study
From level 8 and up, you can start learning additional skills. Each skill unlocks an ability which you can perform
  using the /skill menu.

Your proficiency in a skill is determined by the number of courses you have completed in that skill.

Courses are offered at the Trade School, in [The Outpost](../outpost/index.md). Each time you level up, starting when you reach L8, you
  can complete one additional course.

The skills that you can study are:

ğŸ“š Smithery - gives you the skills to repair items yourself
ğŸ“š First Aid - gives you the skills to perform field healing
ğŸ“š Animal Mastery - gives you the ability to tame a pet to travel with you
Each skill can be further refined to make you better at it by attending additional courses.

You can study a range of different skills, or focus your efforts on a single skill and take repeat courses to gain
  more and more specialized knowledge.

To use a skill, use the `/skill` command

Drunkenness affects your ability to use skills. You have been warned...
