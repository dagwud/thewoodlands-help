## Rest
Rest is a fine medicine. It allows you to recover from your injuries, regain your mana, and sleep off the effects
  of alcohol.

Resting is done at [The Inn](../inn/index.md), where the innkeeper will guarantee your safety while you take a load off.

A short rest will get you up and running again quickly, while a long rest will fully restore you.

You can only perform a finite number of short rests before needing to take a proper break and rest fully.
