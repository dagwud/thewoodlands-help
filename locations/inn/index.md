### The Inn
The Inn is one of the oldest buildings in the Village, but these days it’s rooms are more often empty than not.

It’s been run by the same Innkeeper for as long as anyone can remember - a man beyond reproach who guarantees the
  safety off his guests with his life. Obviously, it’s a guarantee he’s never failed to live up to.

The innkeeper is a friend, and has offered to look after any items you may wish to leave behind while you're out on
  your adventures.

He also offers rooms where weary or beaten travelers can rest.
