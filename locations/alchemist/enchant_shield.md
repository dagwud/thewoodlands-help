### Enchant Shield
Enchanting a shield gives it an extra magical strength. This makes it more effective in blocking attacks.

To enchant a shield, go to the Alchemist. You need to provide the shield to be enchanted, as well as a magical
  trinket, such as a potion, from which the magical essence will be extracted.
