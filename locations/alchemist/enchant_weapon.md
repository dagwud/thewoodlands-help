## Enchant Weapon
Enchanted weapons have been imbued with magical properties.

Creatures that have unenchanted immunity are immune to all weapons that have not been enchanted.

To enchant a Weapon, go to the [Alchemist](../alchemist/index.md). You need to provide the weapon to be enchanted, as well as a magical
  trinket, such as a potion, from which the magical essence will be extracted.
