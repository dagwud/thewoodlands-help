## The Alchemist
The Alchemist is a flashy man, who loves melodrama and excitement. His penchant for drama led to a run-in with the
  mayor, resulting in him having to move shop out to [The Outpost](../outpost/index.md) or face permanent closure.

Here, he scratches out a living offering enchantments - magical improvements to weapons and shields.
