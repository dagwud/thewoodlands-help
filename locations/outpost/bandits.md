### Bandits
The road between [The Village](../village_square/index.md) and [The Outpost](../outpost/index.md) is a dangerous one, home to crews of [Bandits](bandits.md) who prey on
  travelers passing through.

Fortunately theyâ€™re not generally predisposed to violence, so running into bandits will tend to leave you unharmed,
  at the cost of being relieved of some of your items.
