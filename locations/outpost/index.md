### 🏚️ The Outpost 🏚️
Out in the middle of nowhere, The Outpost was once a strategic military vantage point. Over time, though, it has
  decayed through lack of upkeep - thanks largely to misappropriation of funds by the mayor, who preferred to
  “channel” those funds to “investment” in the Tavern. Now it’s very much sub-prime real estate.

The Outpost can be reached via the road from the village (but beware of Bandits) or through the caves - if you can
  find your way.
