### The Blacksmith
An honest man, the Blacksmith has nevertheless been accused of being a thief and a crook by countless (often drunk)
  travelers, and this reputation has taken hold.

Still, he’s a simple man with simple wants. He enjoys the heat of a furnace, the smash of steel on steel, and long
  walks along the Gorge. He dislikes apprentices and unions, and he’s sworn to keep his shop to himself, even if it
  means customers sometimes have to wait.

A resourceful fellow, he can craft just about anything given the right parts, and he has yet to find a weapon so
  damaged that he can’t beat it back into shape. He’s also got a bit of a soft spot, being willing to help out
  inexperienced adventurers from his own stock when necessary.

He also stocks a variety of ammunition, to go in just about every conceivable ranged weapon.
