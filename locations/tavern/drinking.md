## 🍺Drinking
O God, that men should put an enemy into their mouths to steal away their brains!

Alcohol is freely available at [The Tavern](../tavern/index.md). The effects of alcohol are predictable: increased brute strength while
  hitting stuff with other stuff, but decreased accuracy with any weapon that requires aiming. Plus, it messes with
  your mind.

That said, it’s the best way to deal with the death of a fellow traveler.
