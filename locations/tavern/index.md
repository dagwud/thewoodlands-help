### The Tavern
The Raven is a friendly place, where all are welcome as long as they pay for their drinks. A small table off to the
  side of the bar is reserved for regular patrons, and is almost always occupied by the mayor.

The barman is a wily character, whose slick ability to strike up a conversation is matched only by his slick hands,
  which he uses to swap out drinks in order to lure unsuspecting travelers off their guard in the hopes that theyâ€™ll
  spend more time in his tavern.

The back room of the tavern houses a perpetual poker table, and the dusty alley out back is the preferred spot for
  locals and adventurers alike to settle their grievances.
