## Invitation Tokens

### Welcome!
Please be sure to check out the [help pages](index.md) for more info about the game and how to play. 

### Is there a cost for an invitation token?

No. Tokens are only used to provide some control over the limited server resources.

The game is free - no subscription, no microtransactions, nada. 

### Why do I need a token?
This is a hobby game, not some big for-profit thing. It runs on limited server infrastructure, so we need to avoid overloading it. Maybe one day I'll upgrade the hardware, but for now, joining in requires a free invitation token.

### How do I get a token?

Send the bot a `/token` command - that's it. If there are tokens available, you'll be allocated one and you're good to go. 

### What if there are no tokens available?

Ask on the [telegram channel](https://t.me/woodlands_raven) if more tokens can be allocated. This will depend on available server capacity.

### What if the token doesn't work?

Ask on the [telegram channel](https://t.me/woodlands_raven). But it should work... it's really a very simple system.
