## ðŸŽ‰Celebrating

Every few levels, you have the opportunity to celebrate the amazing fighter you're becoming.

On doing so, you will be able to permanently increase your character's [stats](stats.md) by choosing two attributes which can be increased. You can increase one attribute by two points, or you can increase two attributes by one point each. 

When a celebration is available, you'll see the ðŸŽ‰ icon next to your character's name in the /party screen.

To celebrate, head to [The Tavern](../locations/tavern/index.md) and choose the Celebrate option. This option will not be shown if you don't have any celebrations available.
