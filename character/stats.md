## Character Stats

Your character is a unique cherry blossom, with their own strengths and weaknesses, shaped by their experiences and the lessons they have learned. Well, sort of, anyway. 

Each character is defined by a set of statistics, or stats, which describe their individual traits. Higher values for a given stat mean you are better at that, but there's also a balance. You can't be good at everything, so you can choose to be an unstoppable ball of brute strength, but that will come at the cost of being able to dance on your feet and respond nimbly in a fight. 

### Strength
Strength defines your raw hitting power.

A high strength value gives you increased damage when you attack using melee weapons.

### Agility
Ability describes your nimbleness and dexterity.

A higher agility value translates to more damaging attacks with ranged weapons, as well as giving you an edge in the order of attacks during a battle (i.e. fighters with higher agility will get the first chance to attack).

### Constitution
Constitution defines how well you can roll with the punches.

A higher constitution gives you greater hit point recovery for each rest, as well as increasing the number of hit points you gain each time you level up.

## ðŸ’šHit Points / Max Hit Points
Your Hit Points are an indication of your health.

Each character has a maximum HP value, indicating how many hits they can take at full health, as well as a current HP value indicating how many hits they can still take before being knocked unconscious.

If your HP drops to 0, you will be rendered [unconscious](../unconscious.md). A particularly heavy hit in relation to your maximum HP can result in [death](../death.md).

To recover hit points, you will need to [rest](../locations/inn/rest.md) (or perhaps be healed by a team member who has studied [first aid](../locations/trade_school/skills/first_aid.md))

Each time you level up, your maximum HP will be increased slightly, influenced by your Constitution stat, character class, and a bit of luck.

Your HP and maximum HP values can be seen via the /me or /party commands.

## âœ¨Mana / Max Mana
Mana is the fuel that powers special abilities and spells.

Each character has a maximum mana value, indicating how many spells they can cast when fully charged, as well as a current mana value indicating how many spells they can still cast before their rank runs empty.

If your mana drops to 0, you will not be able to cast any more spells.

To recover mana, you will need to [rest](../locations/inn/rest.md)

Your maximum mana will increase every few levels.

Your mana and maximum mana values can be seen via the /me or /party commands.
