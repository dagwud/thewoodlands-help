Higher values for a given stat mean you are better at that, but there's also a balance - you can't be good at everything, so will you can choose to be an unstoppable ball of brute strength, but that will come at the cost of being able to dance on your feet and respond nimbly in a fight.

A high strength value gives you increased damage when you attack using melee weapons.

### Agility

A higher constitution gives you greater hit point recovery for each rest, as well as making your hit point gain each time you level up higher.
