## Character Stats

Your character is a unique cherry blossom, with their own strengths and weaknesses, shaped by their experiences and the lessons they have learned. Well, sort of, anyway. 

Each character is defined by a set of statistics, or stats, which describe their individual traits. Higher values for a given stat mean you are better at that, but there's also a balance. You can't be good at everything, so you can choose to be an unstoppable ball of brute strength, but that will come at the cost of being able to dance on your feet and respond nimbly in a fight. 

### Strength
Strength defines your raw hitting power.

A high strength value gives you increased damage when you attack using melee weapons.

### Agility
Ability describes your nimbleness and dexterity.

A higher agility value translates to more damaging attacks with ranged weapons, as well as giving you an edge in the order of attacks during a battle (i.e. fighters with higher agility will get the first chance to attack).

### Constitution
Constitution defines how well you can roll with the punches.

A higher constitution gives you greater hit point recovery for each rest, as well as increasing the number of hit points you gain each time you level up.
