### Bandits
The road between the Village and The Outpost is a dangerous one, home to crews of bandits who prey on
  travelers passing through.

Fortunately theyâ€™re not generally predisposed to violence, so running into bandits will tend to leave you unharmed,
  at the cost of being relieved of some of your items.
