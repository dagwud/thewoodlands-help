### Carry Limit
Each player has a maximum number of items they can carry at any point in time.

Once you’ve reached your carry limit (which can be seen using the `/inv` command) you will not be able to pick up any
  more items.

You can reduce the number of items you’re carrying by crafting two items into one, giving an item to someone else,
  leaving items at the innkeeper, or just plain dropping an item.

The carry limit only applies to items that are carried, not worn.
