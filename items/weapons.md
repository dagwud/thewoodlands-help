### Weapons
There are two general types of weapons: ⚔️melee weapons, which are used to hit/cut/smash whatever is right in front
  of you, and 🏹ranged weapons, which are used to shoot/throw/lob damaging projectiles at your enemies.

Different weapons do different levels of damage, represented by the Average Hit Damage, a number displayed next to
  the weapon name. This number represents the average amount of damage which will be done when attacking with this
  weapon. Some weapons are most effective when used in the hands of the people most comfortable with them, in which
  case you may see a value like “+3” next to the Average Hit Damage. This means that every attack done will include a
  bonus 3 points of damage due to your comfort with the weapon.

Weapons will take damage with use, and after too much use a weapon will be damaged beyond usefulness. At this point
  you’ll need to repair the weapon before you can continue to use it.

Ranged weapons also have a finite supply of ☄️ammunition. Once your ammunition runs out, you’ll need to restock
  it.
