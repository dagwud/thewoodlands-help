### Ward of Violence

_🏆🏆🏆 Very Rare_ 

The Ward of Violence brings out your inner monster, making you more aggressive.

Any attack you make while wearing the ward will inflict bonus damage (provided you don't miss). 

The effect of the Ward will stay with you as long as it is equipped.

An equipped Ward does not count towards your [Carry Limit](../carry_limit.md).
