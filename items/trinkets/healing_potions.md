## Healing Potions

Healing potions restore your health (i.e. your remaining hit points).

You can drink a potion any time, as long as you're not [unconscious](../../unconscious.md).

Healing Potions come in three sizes, depending on how many hit points they'll heal:
- Potion of Lesser Healing (_Common_)
- Potion of Greater Healing (_🏆 Quite Rare_)
- Potion of Massive Healing (_🏆🏆 Rare_)

Healing can never push you above your maximum (full) hit points. 

You can't drink part of a potion - it's all or nothing. Any extra power beyond what you need will be wasted.
