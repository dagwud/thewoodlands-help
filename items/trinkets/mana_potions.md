## 🧪Mana Potions

Mana potions restore your mana.

You can drink a potion any time, as long as you're not [unconscious](../../unconscious.md).

Mana Potions come in two sizes, depending on how many mana points they'll restore:
- 🧪Lesser Mana Potion (_Common_)                 
- 🧪Mana Potion (_🏆 Quite Rare_)

Mana potions can never push you above your maximum (full) mana points. 

You can't drink part of a potion - it's all or nothing. Any extra power beyond what you need will be wasted.
