## 🔮Ward of Alacrity

_🏆🏆 Rare_ 

The Ward of Alacrity increases your agility for as long as you wear it.

This brings extra nimbleness to your steps (giving you a better ranking in the order of battles), 
and improved accuracy with ranged weapons.

The effect of the Ward will stay with you as long as it is equipped.

An equipped Ward does not count towards your [Carry Limit](../carry_limit.md).
