### 🧪Potions

Potions are single-use trinkets, which give you a once-off benefit when you drink them.

[🧪Mana Potions](mana_potions.md)

### 🔮Wards

Wards are spells which surround you for as long as you choose to keep them equipped, providing an ongoing benefit.

Once equipped, they cannot be put back into your inventory - they can only be [dropped](../drop_item.md).

[🔮Ward of Alacrity](ward_of_alacrity.md)

[🔮Ward of Violence](ward_of_violence.md)

### Worn Items

These are fashion statements with a punch; you wear them on your body, and so they don't count towards your [Carry Limit](../carry_limit.md) as long as you're wearing them.

Note that you can only wear two items at a time. If you try to put on a third wearable item, you will automatically take off one of the items you're already wearing.
