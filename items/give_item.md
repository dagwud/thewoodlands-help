### Give Item
If you’re feeling generous, you can gift any item you’re carrying to any other member of to the party. To do this,
  use the `/give` command.

The would-be recipient must be a member of the same party, conscious, and in the same location as you (for example,
  you can’t give an item to someone who’s in [The Tavern](/locations/tavern/index.md) while you’re in [The Inn](/locations/inn/index.md)).

You also cannot give an item to someone who has reached their carry limit.
