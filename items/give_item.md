### Give Item
If you’re feeling generous, you can gift any item you’re carrying to any other member of to the party. To do this,
  use the `/give` command.

The would-be recipient must be a member of the same party, conscious, and in the same location as you (for example,
  you can’t give an item to someone who’s in the Tavern while you’re in the Inn).

You also cannot give an item to someone who has reached their carry limit.
