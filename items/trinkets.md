### Trinkets
Trinkets are items that grant the holder special abilities.

Trinkets can briskly be divided into two categories: wearables and consumables.

Wearables are items that can be worn - cloaks, rings, beads, etc. They provide the wearer with special abilities,
  such as increased protection, bloodlust, mana regeneration, etc.

Consumables are once-off items, typically potions that you can drink. They give a once-off benefit such as
  restoring health or mana.

Potions can also be used to enchant items at the [Alchemist](/locations/alchemist/index.md).
