### Drop Item
Dropping an item will discard it. Once dropped, an item is lost to you - you cannot pick it up again, nor can
  anyone else.

If your intention is to give someone else one of your weapons, just give it to them. This isnâ€™t a 1990s MUD, for
  crying out loud.

To drop an item, use the `/inv` command and click the `/d` link next to the appropriate item.
