## Equip Item
Equipping an item readies it for active use.

Think of it like this: youâ€™re carrying a bunch of stuff in a bag on your back/strapped to your waist/etc. Equipping
  an item means taking it out and holding it in one of your hands.

You can only attack with weapons that are equipped, and a shield will only protect you if it is equipped.

Equipping certain trinkets, such as potions, will cause you to consume them. Equipping a Potion of Healing, for
  example, will cause you to drink the potion, gaining hit points back. At that point, the potion has been used and
  will disappear from your inventory.

To equip an item, use the `/inv` command and click the `/e` link next to the appropriate item.

For items that are carried in your hands (as opposed to being worn) such as weapons and shields, you can only have two items equipped at a time - one in each hand. If you already have two items equipped, equipping a third will cause one of your equipped items to switch back to being carried.
