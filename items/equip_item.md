### Equip Item
Equipping an item readies if for active use.

Think of it like this: youâ€™re carrying a bunch of stuff in a bag on your back/strapped to your waist/etc. Equipping
  an item means taking it out and holding it in one of your hands.

You can only attack with weapons that are equipped, and a shield will only protect you if it is equipped.

Equipping certain trinkets, such as potions, will cause you to consume them. Equipping a Potion of Healing, for
  example, will cause you to drink the potion, gaining hit points back. At that point, the potion has been used and
  will disappear from your inventory.

To equip an item, use the `/inv` command and click the `/e` link next to the appropriate item.
