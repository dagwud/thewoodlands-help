### ⚕ Immunity
Higher level creatures have ⚕Immunity to certain types of attacks

This will be shown when you encounter the creature, in the same place where you can see its basic stats.

Attacking something that has (for example) ⚕Immunity: Unenchanted with a weapon that’s not been enchanted will do... drumroll... absolutely nothing.

You’ll swing, you’ll hit, and you’ll do 0 damage.
