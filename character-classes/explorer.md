## Explorer
_Ranged Fighter

The Explorer is an archeologist by training, but he found that life too boring (and dusty). He traded in his Trowel and
Shovel for a pair of Hand Axes. 

One might say he's never looked back, but one would be mistaken - with the number of
enemies he's made, he's constantly needed to look over his shoulder. However, he does quite enjoy the freedom of not
having to pay any attention to the preservation of bones.
