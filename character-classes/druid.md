## Druid
_Ranged Fighter_

A student of the mystic herb, the Druid was once voted "Most likely not to turn out a complete failure" by his
classmates. Sadly, druid students are not known for their foresight.

He dropped out of formal studies after failing Forestry a record 420 times. Though he maintains he did it to make a point, he sadly can't remember what his point
was. 

However, his nimble fingers and sharp senses opened the door to another line of work, and he's honed his skills
with ranged weapons to the point where he's become a ranged attacker of some regard.
