## General
_Spellcaster_

A veteran of multiple campaigns and a decorated soldier, the General is well-versed in the Art of Beating 
Stuff Up.

He's still perfectly capable of wielding a weapon, but his real passion has always been teaching. 

Some may scoff, but this is where he leaves his mark on the battle field - his wisdom and affable nature bring out the 
best in those around him.
