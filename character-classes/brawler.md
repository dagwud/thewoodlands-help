## Brawler
_Melee Fighter_

The Brawler is a brick outhouse of a man, built like a stone slab and with a fist to match. He's not an especially
bright chap, but he certainly makes up for his lack of brain with an extra-large serving of braun. His biggest skill
(according to the last time he tried to write a CV) was that he "can make pretty much anything into a club".

It was pointed out to him that doing so wasn't especially difficult, but he deftly responded with a demonstration of how much
damage a lever-arch file in the right pair of hands can do.

Not a person to be trifled with, but he has been known to
become quite sentimental when talking about his favourite axe over a pint or twelve.
