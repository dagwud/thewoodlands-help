## Archer
_Ranged Fighter

The Archer is a jovial person, who likes to think of himself as something of a Robin Hood (but more in the mold of
Cary Elwes than Kevin Costner).

He's mean with pretty much any ranged weapon, and a bit of a show-off.

A lightweight drinker, after a couple of rounds he's wont to regale anyone who'll listen (or who's too polite to leave)
with tales of his adventures, inevitably punctuated with what some call his catchphrase: "You sshhould really try
blindfolded arshery.. There'sh nothing quite like it. You don't know what you're misssssing\"
