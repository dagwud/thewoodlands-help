## Trickster
_Melee Fighter_

A devious character, the Trickster is a fiendish melee fighter who learnt the ropes in bar brawls and underground
hand-to-hand duels for coin. 

An unsavory character, his skills in melee fighting are nevertheless beyond question.

An outlaw, he has quite a reputation after becoming the first person in his home country to successfully execute
his own executioner, after a clever little trick involving rope, a greased axe, and a turkey. Needless to say, he
had to make a quick exit after that, but anyone who crosses paths with him would do well to give him some distance.
