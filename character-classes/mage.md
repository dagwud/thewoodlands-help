## Mage
_Spellcaster_

The Mage started off as a lowly Wizard's Apprentice, making a living performing weddings and Bar Mitvahs. However,
as a young teen he came to the conclusion that Wizards are a pretty daft lot, happy just to learn spells from books 
and then write books about those spells. 

The Mage wanted to leave more of a legacy, and so vested his energies into 
the creation of new spells. 

After several years (and some rather horrific accidents) he has built up a decent repertoire, 
and is considering writing a book. 

But to pay the bills and keep his skills sharp, he still loves a good adventure.
