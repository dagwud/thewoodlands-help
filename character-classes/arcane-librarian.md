## Arcane Librarian
_Spellcaster_

The librarian started his career with a rather simple job as a book-packer at the University, and soon worked his way 
up to the lofty post of Assistant Chief Librarian: Arcana and Elemental Studies. 

Unfortunately, he had to leave under a bit of a cloud after it emerged he'd been smuggling banned materials out to read in 
his off time. It was the view of the University that the knowledge he'd attained was far too dangerous, and so they elected 
to send him out into the world rather to become an S.E.P. 

Now, he tags along with adventurers, offering them the benefits of his wide (theoretical) knowledge of science and magic.
