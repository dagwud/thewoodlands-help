## Chancellor
_Melee Fighter_

The chancellor was previously employed at a large university, where his duties included student affairs and
ceremonial responsibilities such as the conferring of degrees. 

However, the ceremonial power went to his
head and he got the boot after a run-in with the Dean. 

Now, he wonders around as a thug-for-hire, specialising in melee combat - something that years of smacking daft
students into line prepared him for.
