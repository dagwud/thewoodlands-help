### Battles
Battles are the main way to gain experience and items.

A battle is divided into rounds. Each round consists of everyone attacking an opponent, and once each participant
  has done so, the next round will start. This continues until all fighters on one side of the battle are either dead
  or unconscious, or until one side runs away.

The order in which fighters attack in a round is determined based on their agility, with more agile fighters being
  quicker off the mark to get their hits in.

Each fighter will attack with whatever weapons they have equipped. See: Equip Item

If a fighter drops to 0 hit points, they will be knocked unconscious. An unconscious player cannot attack, nor be
  attacked.

Winning a battle results in experience for all participants, and the chance that the defeated creature will drop an
  item.
